# MeteorDBAdmin
Little web project to view and manipulate MongoDB-Collections using Meteor using some MongoDB Meta-information and w2ui for the visualization.

Please not that this will only display simple key-value pairs in a table where the key is the column row and the value is just a basic int/string/boolean.
Works best for data imported from an rational database.
Not all complex or nested data can be visualized in a table.
