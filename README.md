# MeteorDBAdmin
Little web project to view and manipulate MongoDB-Collections using Meteor using some MongoDB Meta-information and [w2ui](http://w2ui.com/) for the visualization.

Please note that this will only display simple key-value pairs in a table where the key is used as the column name and the value is just a basic int/string/boolean.
Works best for data imported from an rational database.
Not all complex or nested data can be visualized in a table, although with some manipulation we could build something like [the Tree-Like Grid Example](http://w2ui.com/web/demos/#!grid/grid-7) from w2ui
